# Release Notes — RPGM-Translator v1.0.0

🎉 **First stable release of RPGM-Translator**, a GUI tool to automatically translate **RPG Maker MV/MZ** games.

---

## 🆕 Latest additions

- **Clear cache** button — delete the global and local translation caches from the GUI.
- **Script literal translation** — translatable strings inside JavaScript event commands (e.g., Oracle tips in `CommonEvents.json`) are now extracted and translated while preserving the surrounding code.
- **RPG Maker dialogue prefix handling** — general logic to handle RPG Maker dialogue prefixes with special separators (`<`, `>`, `}`, `{`, `^`) while translating only the dialogue content.
- **Smart $gameVariables.setValue handling** — intelligently distinguishes between short NPC names (preserved) and dialogue phrases (translated) in script literals.
- **Automatic character name extraction** — automatically extracts character names from `Actors.json` to preserve them from translation.
- **Dynamic filename pattern exclusion** — excludes dynamic filename patterns (e.g., `CHR-`, `-Body`, `-Face`) from translation to prevent crashes.

## ✨ What's New

- **Auto-detect engine** for RPG Maker MV and MZ games.
- **Extract** all translatable strings from:
  - Maps (`Map*.json`)
  - Common events (`CommonEvents.json`)
  - Game database (`System.json`, `Items.json`, `Weapons.json`, `Armors.json`, `Skills.json`, `States.json`, `Enemies.json`, `Actors.json`, `Classes.json`)
  - JavaScript plugins (`js/plugins.js`)
- **Translation backends** supported:
  - Google Turbo
  - Bing Ultra

- **Editable translation table** with filters (All / Translated / Untranslated).

- **Cheat Mod integration**: one-click install of the **Forge for RPGM MV/MZ** plugin, with the **Toggle Cheat UI** hotkey set to the `1` key.
